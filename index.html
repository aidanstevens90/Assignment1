      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been interested in gaming and computer hardware, though I always thought of it as a hobby, never thinking that it could ever be a career for me as I didnâ€™t care too much else about the other areas of IT. After taking a few IT based subjects in high school and then later in university, while I was studying another course, I found out that I enjoyed a lot of the content that was being covered. After hating the degree, I was studying I moved over and began studying IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year I completed my Diploma in IT, feeling a bit disappointed by the delivery of multiple courses and the desire to leave regional NSW, I decided to make the move to Melbourne. Wanting to continue studying and to get my Bachelors. I decided that RMIT was the university for after hearing positive feedback from online and from friends and they offered course that I believed would be more useful than those offered by other intuitions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping that through my studies I can gain skills and knowledge that will allow me to have a fruitful career in IT. I am hoping that the content that is presented to me will be more current.
